# Multi-Agent System Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the multi-agent system architecture for our algorithmic trading project. It details the hierarchical structure, agent responsibilities, workflow patterns, communication protocols, security considerations, and scalability strategies to ensure optimal performance and efficient collaboration. The system is composed of seven specialized agents:

1. **Executive Architect** @file .cursor/rules/101-executive-architect-agent.mdc
2. **Frontend Developer** @file .cursor/rules/102-frontend-developer-agent.mdc
3. **Backend Developer** @file .cursor/rules/103-backend-developer-agent.mdc
4. **Full-Stack Integrator** @file .cursor/rules/104-full-stack-integrator-agent.mdc
5. **CMS Specialist** @file .cursor/rules/105-cms-specialist-agent.mdc
6. **Data Engineer** @file .cursor/rules/106-data-engineer-agent.mdc
7. **Documentation Specialist** @file .cursor/rules/107-doc-specialist-agent.mdc

Each agent is governed by its own dedicated `.mdc` rule file (referenced above) that sets guidelines for its behavior and interactions.

## Hierarchical Structure

At the top level, the **Executive Architect** oversees the entire project. This role is responsible for strategy, coordination, and ensuring that all team members work cohesively. All other agents operate within clearly defined domains but interact frequently through established communication protocols and shared resources.

## Communication Protocols

Agent Shared Scratchpad Communication System @file 200-scratchpad.mdc 

## Overview
This document defines the implementation of the shared scratchpad communication system that enables seamless information exchange and coordination between the multi-agent system in the project. The scratchpad serves as a centralized memory and communication hub with structured partitions, access controls, and rich messaging capabilities.

### Scratchpad Storage and Management

The scratchpad implements a dual-storage approach optimized for both performance and readability:

1. **SQLite Primary Storage**: 
   - Uses a local SQLite database stored at `.cursor/communication/logs/scratchpad.db`
   - Provides efficient querying, filtering, and indexing of messages
   - Ensures data integrity through transactional operations
   - Maintains relationships between messages, threads, and metadata
   - Enables fast access for real-time agent communication

2. **JSON File Backup Storage**:
   - Maintains human-readable backups of all scratchpad data
   - Organizes files in a logical directory structure at `.cursor/communication/logs/backup/[DATE]/[THREAD_ID]/[MESSAGE_ID].json`
   - Enables easy inspection, debugging, and data recovery
   - Preserves complete message history in an easily accessible format
   - Files are organized by date and thread for simple navigation

This hybrid approach offers the best of both worlds: high-performance database operations through SQLite and transparent, easily readable data through organized JSON files. The JSON backups are particularly valuable for developers to inspect the communication history and debug agent interactions without needing to query the database directly.

## Available tools for the agents
- **Brave-Search:**
  - Using this tool the agents can easily search the web for whatever they may need information wise on demand
  - gather up to date insights on everything
